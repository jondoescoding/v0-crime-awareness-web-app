# Clean Project

I'll safely clean up development artifacts while preserving your working code.

**Safety First**: Before any cleanup, I'll create a backup of potentially important files to prevent accidental data loss.

I'll identify and remove:
- **Debug/Log Files**: .log, debug.txt, error.out
- **Temporary Files**: .tmp, .temp, swap files, editor backups
- **Build Artifacts**: Compiled files, cache directories specific to your build system
- **Development Artifacts**: Coverage reports, profiling data, benchmark results

**Protected Directories** (never touched):
- .claude, .git, .svn - version control and AI assistance
- Essential configs, package files, source code
- Documented important files in your project

My cleanup process:
1. **Analyze**: Scan project to identify cleanable files
2. **Categorize**: Group findings by file type and safety level
3. **Confirm**: Show you exactly what will be removed
4. **Backup**: Create safety backup of anything uncertain
5. **Clean**: Remove approved files
6. **Verify**: Ensure project still builds/runs correctly

After cleanup, I'll:
- Report space saved and files removed
- Verify your project still works (run builds/tests if configured)
- Provide rollback instructions if needed
- Suggest .gitignore additions to prevent future clutter

If cleanup breaks anything:
- I'll help restore from the backup
- Identify what went wrong
- Adjust the cleanup strategy for future runs

This keeps your project clean and efficient while maintaining complete safety of your important work.
