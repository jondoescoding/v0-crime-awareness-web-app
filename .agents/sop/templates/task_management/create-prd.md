# Rule: Generating a Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) in Markdown format, based on an initial user prompt. The PRD should be clear, actionable, and suitable for a very new junior developer to understand and implement the feature that is being tasked to them.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides a brief description or request for a new feature or functionality.
2.  **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Before writing the PRD, the AI *must* ask clarifying questions to gather sufficient detail. The goal is to understand the "what" and "why" of the feature, not the "how" as this is what the AI assistant will figure out. 
Make sure to provide options in numbered lists with letters so I can respond easily with my selections.

example:
Clarifying Questions
1. Core Functionality:
a) Basic nearest stations search (find 5 closest stations to user's coordinates)
b) Advanced search with filters (fuel type, price range, ratings, operating hours)
c) Route-based search (find stations along a planned route)

3.  **Generate PRD:** Based on the initial prompt and the user's answers to the clarifying questions, generate a PRD using the structure outlined below.
4.  **Save PRD:** Save the generated document as `[n]-prd-[feature-name].md` inside the `/tasks` directory. (Where `n` is a zero-padded 4-digit sequence starting from 0001, e.g., `0001-prd-user-authentication.md`, `0002-prd-dashboard.md`, etc.)

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

The AI should adapt its questions based on the prompt, but here are some common areas to explore:

*   **Problem/Goal:** "What problem does this feature solve for the user?" or "What is the main goal we want to achieve with this feature?"
*   **Target User:** "Who is the primary user of this feature?"
*   **Core Functionality:** "Can you describe the key actions a user should be able to perform with this feature?"
*   **User Stories:** "Could you provide a few user stories? (e.g., As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that [benefit].)"
*   **Acceptance Criteria:** "How will we know when this feature is successfully implemented? What are the key success criteria?"
*   **Scope/Boundaries:** "Are there any specific things this feature *should not* do (non-goals)?"
*   **Data Requirements:** "What kind of data does this feature need to display or manipulate?"
*   **Design/UI:** "Are there any existing design mockups or UI guidelines to follow?" or "Can you describe the desired look and feel?"
*   **Edge Cases:** "Are there any potential edge cases or error conditions we should consider?"

## PRD Structure

The generated PRD should include the following sections:

0. the top of the file should have within the frontmatter:
```
---
name: [name of prd]
status: [todo, in-progress, done]
created: [in plain english -> date and time]
Total tasks: x
Completed: x (xx%)
In progress: x (NAME OF TASK)
Pending: x
tasks:
  prd: [file location]
  tasks_to_be_done: [list of tasks (and their accompanying sub-tasks), which should be other markdown files]
---
```
1.  **Introduction/Overview:** Briefly describe the feature and the problem it solves. State the goal.
2.  **Goals:** List the specific, measurable objectives for this feature.

2.5 **Dependencies**: 
**external dependencies**:
[any requirements which need support from outside of the interal components]

**internal dependencies**:
[any current implementation within the system]

**prerequisite work**:
[any features which needs to be built out first]


3.  **User Stories:** Detail the user narratives describing feature usage and benefits.
4.  **Functional Requirements:** List the specific functionalities the feature must have. Use clear, concise language (e.g., "The system must allow users to upload a profile picture."). Number these requirements.
5.  **Non-Goals (Out of Scope):** Clearly state what this feature will *not* include to manage scope.
6.  **Design Considerations (Optional):** Link to mockups, describe UI/UX requirements, or mention relevant components/styles if applicable.
7.  **Technical Considerations (Optional):** Mention any known technical constraints, dependencies, or suggestions (e.g., "Should integrate with the existing Auth module").
8.  **Success Metrics:** How will the success of this feature be measured? (e.g., "Increase user engagement by 10%", "Reduce support tickets related to X").
9. **Accomplishments:** Overall documented progress of the project

9's format: 
(this is the section which should be used as the task is being accomplished)
## ‚úÖ [Accomplishment] (CODING SESSION: [date-time-in-plain-english])

### üéØ **Technical Architecture 

### üìÅ **Files Created/Modified**

### üîß **Problem-Solving Approaches**

#### **what changed in plain english**

### üöß **Remaining Work**


## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the PRD is a **junior developer**. Therefore, requirements should be explicit, unambiguous, and avoid jargon where possible. Provide enough detail for them to understand the feature's purpose and core logic.

## Output

*   **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
*   **Location:** `/tasks/`
*   **Filename:** `[n]-prd-[feature-name].md`

## Final instructions

1. Do NOT start implementing the PRD
2. Make sure to ask the user clarifying questions
3. Take the user's answers to the clarifying questions and improve the PRD
