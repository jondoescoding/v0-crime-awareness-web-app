# Project Style Guide

## Tone & Messaging
- Keep copy direct, action-oriented, and aware of urgency.
- Use clear labels for offender details, incidents, and emergency contacts.
- Highlight safety actions (“Report”, “Call”, “View on Map”) with concise wording.

## Visual Priorities
- Emphasize high-contrast layouts so alerts stand out in stressful situations.
- Use color intentionally: red for confirmed threats, yellow for AI predictions, neutral for supporting info.
- Surface “New” badges subtly but visibly to signal fresh intelligence.

## Interaction Patterns
- Minimize friction in form flows; validations should guide, not block.
- Auto-refresh data views without requiring user input.
- Ensure map and list views stay synchronized when switching contexts.

## Accessibility
- Favor readable typography and sizable touch targets for field use.
- Provide offline-friendly capture cues where the camera flow is available.
