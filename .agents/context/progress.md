# Progress

## Repository Status
- Branch: feature/data-enrichment-epic (tracking origin/feature/data-enrichment-epic).
- Git state: working tree still dirty; major activity centers on new .codex docs, enrichment scripts, and removal of legacy .claude automation assets.
- Untracked: ackend/scripts/run_full_enrichment.py, refreshed enriched datasets under ackend/data/enriched_data/september_4_2025/, expanded backend test scaffolding, .codex context files.
- Environment: .env with FIRECRAWL_API_KEY and SERPER_API_KEY confirmed; enrichment pipeline runs end-to-end locally.

## Recent Commits
1. 253b235 – Merge branch 'main' into feature/data-enrichment-epic.
2. f4d8f5a – Added data enrichment and voice call agent scripts for gas station information.
3. db76df5 – Documentation update to CLAUDE.md (now removed locally).

## Active Workstreams
- Full September 2025 enrichment run executed (task 006 now in review) with thumbnails enabled; outputs captured in metadata and PRD.
- Backend follow-up: harden enrichment heuristics for stations that missed matches, fold automation script into tooling, and add targeted tests.
- Frontend: mobile app still consuming mock data; integration with enriched API remains pending.

## Risks / Blockers
- Three stations (FESCO, INDEPENDENT, TEXACO) still missing coordinates/thumbnails; requires query tuning or special-case fallbacks.
- README/runbook guidance for batch scripts not yet updated, risking knowledge gaps for future runs.
- Large .claude deletions awaiting confirmation before they can be committed alongside new .codex assets.

## Next Steps
- Iterate on enrichment query strategy or manual overrides for unresolved stations and duplicate COOL OASIS entries.
- Document script usage (--include-images flow, troubleshooting) and record manual spot-check results to close task 006.
- Connect Expo mobile Home tab to live enrichment data and surface loading/error states via React Query.
- Align on repository hygiene plan for replacing .claude with .codex before finalizing commits.
