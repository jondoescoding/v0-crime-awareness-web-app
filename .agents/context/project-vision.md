# Project Vision

## North Star
- Deliver the definitive, always-current snapshot of fuel prices and station amenities across Jamaica, accessible instantly from a mobile device.
- Combine automated web extraction, enrichment APIs, and human verification loops to maintain data accuracy that rivals on-site audits.

## Strategic Objectives
1. **Operational Reliability**: Automate nightly extraction and enrichment runs with alerting so stakeholders trust the dataset without manual intervention.
2. **User Trust**: Provide transparent metadata (source timestamps, enrichment confidence) inside the app to build confidence in station recommendations.
3. **Monetization Readiness**: Build subscription-ready foundations (auth, secure storage, notification preferences) to unlock premium alerting and analytics tiers.
4. **Extensibility**: Architect services so new data sources (voice call agent, utility APIs, crowdsourcing) can plug into the enrichment pipeline with minimal rework.

## Future Opportunities
- Integrate geofenced alerts and routing assistance once reliable coordinates are available for most stations.
- Offer historical price charts and predictive insights based on archived extraction runs stored under backend/data/.
- Partner with fuel retailers for promotional slots once data freshness and attribution are proven.
- Expand coverage to other Caribbean territories by generalizing extraction pipelines and localization assets.

## Key Risks and Mitigations
- **API Dependency**: Firecrawl and serper.dev rate limits or policy changes could disrupt updates; plan fallback scraping strategies and request quotas in advance.
- **Data Quality**: Inconsistent station naming or duplicates may mislead users; enforce normalization, add dedupe heuristics, and surface QA dashboards.
- **Mobile Adoption**: Reliance on mock data during development may stall app validation; prioritize wiring the backend once enrichment outputs stabilize.
- **Operational Cost**: Enrichment calls can be expensive at national scale; batch processing with retry backoff and caching should minimize redundant API hits.

## Upcoming Milestones
- Complete the September 2025 full data enrichment run and publish run_metadata.json for auditability.
- Wire the mobile Home tab to live enrichment responses with graceful loading and offline fallback.
- Implement automated test coverage for stage02_api_client and orchestrator error scenarios.
- Establish CI checks (lint, pytest) and deployment scripts for backend releases.
