# Convex Migration Summary

## Overview

Your Next.js Crime Awareness Web App has been successfully migrated to use Convex as the backend database and real-time sync engine. All mock data has been replaced with live Convex queries and mutations.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Convex Provider Setup

**Files Created:**
- `components/convex-provider.tsx` - Convex client provider wrapper

**Files Modified:**
- `app/layout.tsx` - Wrapped the app with `ConvexClientProvider`

### 2. Convex Backend Functions

**Files Created:**

#### `convex/criminals.ts`
- `list` query - List/search all criminals
- `get` query - Get a single criminal by ID
- `create` mutation - Create a new criminal entry

#### `convex/crimeReports.ts`
- `list` query - List crime reports with optional filtering by status/offense type
- `create` mutation - Create a new crime report
- `getByCriminal` query - Get all reports for a specific criminal

#### `convex/seed.ts`
- `seedDatabase` mutation - Populate database with initial mock data
  - 6 sample criminals
  - 4 sample crime reports

### 3. Frontend Component Updates

**All components now use Convex hooks instead of mock data:**

#### `app/database/page.tsx`
- Uses `useQuery(api.criminals.list)` to fetch criminals
- Real-time search functionality
- Loading states for async data

#### `components/criminal-selector.tsx`
- Uses `useQuery(api.criminals.list)` for criminal selection
- Real-time search and filtering
- Proper TypeScript typing with Convex IDs

#### `app/feed/page.tsx`
- Uses `useQuery(api.crimeReports.list)` to fetch activity feed
- Filters by status (all, active, investigating, resolved)
- Shows real crime reports from database

#### `app/map/page.tsx`
- Uses `useQuery(api.crimeReports.list)` to show crimes on map
- Filters by status
- Only shows reports with location data

#### `components/report-form.tsx`
- Uses `useMutation(api.crimeReports.create)` to submit reports
- Integrates with criminal selector for "Known Criminal" reports
- Full form validation and error handling
- Loading states during submission

## Data Migration

The mock data has been transformed to match the Convex schema:

### From Feed Page Mock Data → Crime Reports Table
- Activity types (report, update, alert) → reportType field
- Status tracking (active, investigating, resolved)
- Location information
- Timestamps and descriptions

### From Database Page Mock Data → Criminals Table
- Criminal profiles with names and aliases
- Status (Wanted, At Large)
- Crime classifications
- Location coordinates for mapping
- Descriptive information

### From Map Page Mock Data → Crime Reports Table
- Coordinate-based crime data
- Severity levels → status mapping
- Crime types → offenseType field

## New Features Enabled by Convex

### 1. Real-time Synchronization
All data updates appear instantly across all connected clients without page refresh.

### 2. Optimistic Updates
Form submissions and data changes feel instant with Convex's built-in optimistic UI updates.

### 3. Type Safety
Full TypeScript support with automatically generated types from your schema.

### 4. Reactive Queries
Components automatically re-render when data changes in the database.

### 5. Scalability
Convex handles scaling, caching, and performance optimization automatically.

## Schema Enhancements

The existing schema in `convex/schema.ts` already includes additional tables for future features:

- **users** - For authentication and user management
- **locations** - For detailed location tracking with police contacts
- **persons** - Alternative criminal tracking system
- **tips** - For anonymous tip submission

These tables are ready to use when you want to implement these features.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Install Dependencies** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Start Convex Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npx convex dev
   ```
   This will prompt you to create/link a Convex project and generate your deployment URL.

3. **Create `.env.local`** file:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment-url.convex.cloud
   ```
   (Copy the URL from the Convex dev output)

4. **Seed the Database**:
   ```bash
   npx convex run seed:seedDatabase
   ```

5. **Start Next.js**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

### Recommended Enhancements

1. **File Upload Integration**
   - The form collects files but doesn't upload them yet
   - Use Convex Storage API to upload images and documents
   - Update `fileUploads` field with actual storage IDs

2. **Geocoding Integration**
   - Add geocoding service to convert addresses to coordinates
   - Populate `locationLat` and `locationLng` fields automatically
   - Enable accurate map visualization

3. **User Authentication**
   - Implement user registration and login
   - Use the existing `users` table
   - Add authentication to report submission

4. **Enhanced Search**
   - Implement full-text search using Convex search indexes
   - Add filters for crime type, date range, location
   - Create advanced search UI

5. **Real Map Integration**
   - Replace map placeholder with Mapbox, Google Maps, or Leaflet
   - Plot crimes at actual coordinates
   - Add clustering for dense areas

6. **Notifications**
   - Set up email notifications for new reports
   - Add in-app notifications for status updates
   - Create alert system for nearby crimes

7. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Add crime statistics and trends
   - Create visualizations with the existing data
   - Track report resolution rates
